              <p>
                I’m a dad, a husband, an Air Force veteran, and a <strong class="red-highlight">software engineer</strong> who builds with purpose at the intersection of <strong class="red-highlight">AI</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">UI</strong>, and <strong class="red-highlight">Big Data</strong>. My career has been shaped by a mission to solve real problems for the people and communities I care about, starting with <strong class="red-highlight">veterans</strong> like me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I design and develop systems that bring <strong class="red-highlight">AI</strong> to life through clean user interfaces, thoughtful data architecture, and scalable machine learning infrastructure. I’ve built and deployed <strong class="red-highlight">LLMs</strong>, designed robust <strong class="red-highlight">ETL pipelines</strong>, and shipped end-to-end products using tools like <strong class="red-highlight">Python</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">Azure OpenAI</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">Google Gemini</strong>, and modern JavaScript frameworks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m also a <strong class="red-highlight">writer</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">instructor</strong>, and <strong class="red-highlight">community leader</strong>. I’ve taught developers through <strong class="red-highlight">LinkedIn Learning</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">Frontend Masters</strong>, led <strong class="red-highlight">Vets Who Code</strong> for over a decade, and mentored countless veterans transitioning into tech. I’ve spoken on major stages, collaborated with industry leaders, and helped secure millions in salaries for veterans breaking into this field.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything you see here reflects the <strong class="red-highlight">work</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">learning</strong>, and <strong class="red-highlight">purpose</strong> that define my journey. This is where I show what I’ve built and where I’m going next.

        <div class="container">
          <h2 class="section-title">My JavaScript Journey</h2>
          <p>When I first got into tech, I was building backend applications with <strong class="red-highlight">Ruby on Rails</strong>. It was clean, structured, and made a lot of sense to me. But around <strong class="red-highlight">2016</strong>, I made a conscious pivot to <strong class="red-highlight">front-end development</strong>. I've always loved <strong class="red-highlight">HTML</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">CSS</strong>. The immediacy, the creativity, and the direct connection to how users experience the web really drew me in.</p>
            <p><strong class="red-highlight">JavaScript</strong>, on the other hand, didn’t click with me right away. It wasn’t intuitive at first. The learning curve was steep, and for a while, I avoided going too deep. What changed everything was discovering <strong class="red-highlight">data visualization</strong>. Being able to turn raw, abstract data into something visual and emotionally resonant, something non-technical people could understand and care about, gave me a reason to push through the hard parts. That purpose gave <strong class="red-highlight">JavaScript</strong> new meaning.</p>
            <p>From there, I leaned into the <strong class="red-highlight">front-end ecosystem</strong>. I worked with <strong class="red-highlight">Angular</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">React on Rails</strong>, and eventually <strong class="red-highlight">React</strong> itself. React’s declarative nature and composability made it easier to structure complex applications. I even worked with <strong class="red-highlight">Ember.js</strong> on a few projects. The more I built, the more comfortable I became. <strong class="red-highlight">JavaScript</strong> became a language I didn’t just use. I started thinking in it.</p>
            <p>I’ve been fortunate to work on some large-scale projects that sharpened my skills and tested my resolve. At <strong class="red-highlight">CBS Interactive</strong>, I contributed to <strong class="red-highlight">Sportsline.com</strong>, where real-time data and performance were critical. I also worked on <strong class="red-highlight">ComicBook.com</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">PopCulture.com</strong>, where we had to deliver fast, content-heavy user experiences to massive audiences.</p>
            <p>Two of my biggest wins as a <strong class="red-highlight">JavaScript engineer</strong> came from tackling <strong class="red-highlight">performance</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">accessibility</strong> issues directly.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I led a deep cleanup of a tangled <strong class="red-highlight">Webpack</strong> configuration which resulted in a <strong class="red-highlight">67 percent performance improvement</strong>. That win didn't just make our app faster. It reduced build times, sped up deployments, and gave the team back hours of productivity every week.</li>
              <li>I also stepped in to resolve long-standing <strong class="red-highlight">accessibility</strong> issues that were exposing the company to legal risk. I helped bring us into compliance faster than projected, avoiding the cost and complexity of a <strong class="red-highlight">two million dollar lawsuit</strong>. That work wasn't flashy, but it was necessary and it made the product better for everyone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong class="red-highlight">JavaScript</strong> isn’t just code to me anymore. It’s how I build <strong class="red-highlight">accessible</strong>, <strong class="red-highlight">performant</strong>, impactful experiences at scale. It’s how I solve problems that matter, not just to engineers, but to users and stakeholders who rely on digital experiences every day.</p>
            <p>Beyond my day-to-day engineering work, I’m most proud of founding and leading <strong class="red-highlight">Vets Who Code</strong>. For over a decade, I’ve taught <strong class="red-highlight">veterans</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">military spouses</strong> from around the world, helping them transition into tech careers. Through hands-on instruction, mentorship, and a supportive community, I’ve helped hundreds of <strong class="red-highlight">veterans</strong> and <strong class="red-highlight">spouses</strong> gain the skills and confidence to thrive in software engineering. Seeing their success stories—people who once wore the uniform now building the future of technology—reminds me why I do this work.</p>
